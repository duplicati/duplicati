RestoreFromPython
by Ben Fisher, https://github.com/downpoured
a Python script to restore files from Duplicati
similar to Duplicati.RecoveryTool, but with no dependencies on Mono/.NET
uses streaming apis to restore a large number of files and use limited RAM.



Usage:
1) Confirm that your Duplicati data is on disk in .zip or .zip.aes format.
if data uses GPG/other encryption, decrypt files to .zip before running this tool.

2) Install Python 3 if it is not already installed.

3) Run restore_from_python.py,
it will interactively ask for the necessary information.
