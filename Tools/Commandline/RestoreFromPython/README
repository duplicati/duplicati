RestoreFromPython
by Ben Fisher, https://github.com/downpoured
a Python script to restore files from Duplicati
similar to Duplicati.RecoveryTool, but with no dependencies on Mono/.NET
uses streaming apis to restore a large number of files and use limited RAM.



Usage:
1) Confirm that your Duplicati data is on disk in .zip or .zip.aes format.
if data uses GPG/other encryption than AES, decrypt files to .zip before running this tool.

2) Install Python 3 if it is not already installed.
 pip -m pip install pycryptodome ipython
 optionally you can install aescrypt that will allow to cache the decrypted files
 (at cost of higher disk space)

3) Run restore_from_python.py,
it will interactively ask for the necessary information.
there is support for passing the necessary parameters in command line, use --help
Tentative support for attributes restoration on Linux (needs sudo)
