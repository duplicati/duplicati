This folder is used to store updates.

Each folder is checked before launch to ensure the integrity of the application.

DO NOT MODIFY THE FOLDERS!

This means:
DO NOT CHANGE ANY FILES!
DO NOT DELETE ANY FILES!
DO NOT ADD ANY FILES!
DO NOT EXECUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION ANY FILES!

If anything is changed, the updates will be rejected, and a previous version is used.

If you need to modify something, use the folder where the application is installed.
