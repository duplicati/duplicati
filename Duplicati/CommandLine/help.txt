# This file is the help for the Duplicati Command Line Client. It shows what 
# commands the CLI understands and what the outputs are. Sometimes we used
# placeholders for options. In that case descriptions are taken directly from
# the modules. Sometimes we described options here. The reason for that is, 
# that we found the new description much better but did not want to create a 
# need for translation as many options are described in the UI as well and 
# they are translated there.

Make an encrypted backup
========================
  The following command will make an encrypted backup and store it on an FTP server. The first backup will be full followed by 10 incremental backups before another full backup is made. As no passphrase is specified, the user will be prompted for a password. The upload speed is throttled to 500kB/s.
  
  %MONO%"%APP_PATH%" backup 
    "%EXAMPLE_SOURCE_PATH%" "ftp://ftp.example.com/target"
    --ftp-username=username
    --ftp-password=password
    --full-if-more-than-n-incrementals=10
    --auto-cleanup
    --max-upload-pr-second=500kB


Delete old backups
==================
  The following command will delete old backups. If no passphrase is specified, the user will be prompted for a passphrase. The option --force is required to delete the files; without that option no files will be deleted. Duplicati does not delete backup files that are required to restore files from a valid newer backup (a full backup is always required to restore files from an incremental backup).
  
  %MONO%"%APP_PATH%" delete-older-than 10D 
    "ftp://ftp.example.com/target"
    --ftp-username=username
    --ftp-password=password
    --force


Restore a specific file
=======================
  The following command will restore "%EXAMPLE_SOURCE_FILE%" from the backup in the latest version to the local folder "%EXAMPLE_RESTORE_PATH%".
  
  %MONO%"%APP_PATH%" restore 
    "ftp://ftp.example.com/target" "%EXAMPLE_RESTORE_PATH%"
    --ftp-username=username
    --ftp-password=password
    --file-to-restore="%EXAMPLE_SOURCE_FILE%"
    

# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help backup
  
Usage: backup <source folder> <target url> <options>

  This will perform full or incremental backups. It reads all files from <source folder> and stores the backups in <target url>. If no rule for full backups is specified, Duplicati will create one full backup and incremental backups afterwards. Multiple source folders have to be separated by the operating system's delimiter (semicolon ";" on Windows, colon ":" on Linux).

Options:
  --auto-cleanup
    Removes all files that do not belong to the backup (e.g. partial files caused by interrupted uploads).
  --backup-prefix = <string>
    Replaces the default "duplicati" with <string> in the file names of the backup files. It is required to specify different prefixes if multiple backups are stored in the same target folder.
  --full
    Make a full backup. If nothing is specified, an initial full backup is made with incremental backups afterwards.
  --full-if-older-than = <date> 
    Make a new full backup after the specified relative date or time.
  --full-if-more-than-n-incrementals = <number>
    Make a full backup after n incremental backups.
  --max-upload-pr-second = <size>
    Limits the upload speed to the specified value. <size> is interpreted as bandwidth/s.
  --no-encryption
    The backup is NOT encrypted with a passphrase. Unencrypted files are stored.
  --passphrase = <passphrase>
    The passphrase that is used to encrypt the backup. If nothing is specified here, the environment variable PASSPHRASE will be used or the user will be prompted to type in the passphrase. 
  --volsize = <size>
    The maximum size of files being written to the target. Default size is 10MB.
