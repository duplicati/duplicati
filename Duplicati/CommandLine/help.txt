# This file is the help for the Duplicati Command Line Client. It shows what 
# commands the CLI understands and what the outputs are. Sometimes we used
# placeholders for options. In that case descriptions are taken directly from
# the modules. Sometimes we described options here. The reason for that is, 
# that we found the new description much better but did not want to create a 
# need for translation as many options are described in the UI as well and 
# they are translated there.

Make an encrypted backup
========================
  The following command will make an encrypted backup and store it on an FTP server. As no passphrase is specified, the user is prompted for a password. The upload speed is throttled to 500kB/s. Backups older than onemonth are considered old. Old backups are deleted automatically. The maximum file size is limited to 50MB (default). 
  
  %MONO%"%APP_PATH%" backup ftp://me:example.com@ftp.example.com/target "%EXAMPLE_SOURCE_PATH%" --throttle=500kB
  
Search for files in a backup
============================
  The backup can be searched for specific files. The following command returns all files "%EXAMPLE_SOURCE_FILE%" of the last backup. File names can also contain the wildcards * and ?. 
  
  %MONO%"%APP_PATH%" find ftp://me:example.com@ftp.example.com/target "%EXAMPLE_SOURCE_FILE%"

Restore a specific file
=======================
  The following command will restore "%EXAMPLE_SOURCE_FILE%" from the backup in the latest version to its original destination and overwrite an existing file.
  
  %MONO%"%APP_PATH%" restore ftp://me:example.com@ftp.example.com/target "%EXAMPLE_SOURCE_FILE%" --overwrite
    

# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help backup
  
Usage: backup <storage-URL> "<source-path>" [<options>]

  Makes a backup of <source-path> and stores it in <storage-URL>. The format for <storage-URL> is 
    protocol://username:password@hostname:port/path?backend_option1=value1&backend_option2=value2. 
  Multiple source paths can be specified if they are separated by a space.

  <username> must not contain : and <password> must not contain @. If they do, specify username and password using --auth-username and --auth-password, or url-encode them.

  --auth-password=<string>
    The password that is required to authenticate with the server the backup is stored on.
  --auth-username=<string>
    The username that is required to authenticate with the server the backup is stored on.
  --no-encryption=<boolean>
    Use this to make an unencrypted backup.
  --passphrase
    This is the passphrase that is used to encrypt all data before it is uploaded. If an empty passphrase is specified, the backup will not be encrypted. This is the same as using --no-encryption.
  --prefix=<string>
    Replaces the default "duplicati" with <string> in the file names of the backup files. It is required to specify different prefixes if multiple backups are stored in the same target folder.


# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help find
> duplicati.commandline.exe help list

Usage: find <storage-URL> ["<filename>"] [<options>]

  Finds specific files in specific backups. If <filename> is specified, all occurrences of <filename> in the backup are listed. <filename> can contain * and ? as wildcards. File names in [brackets] are interpreted as regular expression. Latest backup is searched by default. If entire path is specified, all available versions of the file are listed. If no <filename> is specified, a list of all available backups is shown.

  --time=<time>
    Shows what the files looked like at a specific time. Absolute and relative times can be specified.
  --version=<int>
    Shows what the files looked like in a specific backup. If no version is specified the latest backup (version=0) will be used. If nothing is found, older backups will besearched automatically.
  --include=<string>
    Reduces the list of files in a backup to those that match the provided string. This is applied before the search is executed. 
  --exclude=<string>
    Removes matching files from the list of files in a backup. This is applied before the search is executed. 
  --all-versions=<boolean>
    Searches in all backup sets, instead of just searching the latest


# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help restore

Usage: restore <storage-URL> ["<filename>"] [<options>]
  
  Restores <filename> to its original destination. If <filename> exists already, <filename> is changed to <filename-timestamp.extension>. To restore all files use "*" or leave empty.

  --overwrite=<boolean>
    Overwrites existing files.
  --restore-path=<string>
    Restores files to <restore-path> instead of their original destination. Top folders are removed if possible.
  --time=<time>
    Restore files that are older than the specified time.
  --version=<int>
    Restore files from a specific backup.


	
# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help delete

Usage: delete <storage-URL> [<options>]
  
  Marks old data deleted and removes outdated dlist files. A backup is deleted when it is older than <keep-time> or when there are more newer versions than <keep-versions>. Data is considered old, when it is not required from any existing backup anymore.
  
  --keep-time=<time>
    Marks data outdated that is older than <time>.
  --keep-versions=<int>
    Marks data outdated that is older than <int> versions.
  --version=<int>
    Deletes all files that belong to the specified version(s).
  
  
  
# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help compact

Usage: compact <storage-URL> [<options>]
  
  Old data is not deleted immediately as in most cases only small parts of a dblock file are old data. When the amount of old data in a dblock file grows it might be worth to replace it. This is especially the case when the number of dblock files and thus the required storage space can be reduced. When backups are frequently made and only few files have changed, the uploaded dblock files are small. At some point it might make sense to replace a large number of small files with one large file. This is what compacting does.
  
  --small-file-max-count=<int>
    The maximum allowed number of small files.
  --small-file-size=<int>
    Files smaller than this size are considered to be small and will be compacted with other small files as soon as there are <small-file-max-count> of them. --small-file-size=20 means 20% of <dblock-size>. 
  --threshold=<percent_value> 
    The amount of old data that a dblock file can contain before it is considered to be replaced.
	
	

  
# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help compare

Usage: compare <storage-URL> [<base-version>] [<compare-to>] [<options>]

  Compares two backups and shows differences. If no versions are given, changes are shown between the two latest backups. The versions can either be timestamps or backup version numbers. If only one version is given, the most recent backup is compared to that version.

  --verbose
    Shows names of files
  --include=<filter>
    Adds an include filter (for verbose output)
  --exclude=<filter>
    Adds an exclude filter (for verbose output)



# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help create-report

Usage: create-report <storage-URL> <output-file> [<options>]

  Analyses the backup and prepares a report with anonymous information. This report can be sent to the developers for a better analysis in case something went wrong.




# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help repair

Usage: repair <storage-URL> [<options>]
  
  Tries to repair the backup. If no local db is found or the db is empty, the db is re-created with data from the storage. If the db is in place but the remote storage is corrupt, the remote storage gets repaired with local data (if available).




# =============================================================================
> duplicati.commandline.exe help test
> duplicati.commandline.exe help verify

Usage: test <storage-URL> [<samples>] [<options>]
  
  Verifies integrity of a backup. A random sample of dlist, dindex, dblock files is downloaded, decrypted and the content is checked against recorded size values and data hashes. <samples> specifies the number of samples to be tested. If "all” is specified, all files in the backup will be tested. This is a rolling check, i.e. when executed another time different samples are verified than in the first run. A sample consists of 1 dlist, 1 dindex, 1 dblock.
  
  --time=<time>
    Checks samples from a specific time.
  --version=<int>
    Checks samples from specific versions. Delimiters are , -
