Duplicati Recovery Tool
=======================

This tool performs a recovery of as much data as possible in small steps that must be performed in order.
We recommend that you use %CLI_EXE% to do the restore, and rely only on this tool if all else fails.


The steps to perform are:
-------------------------

1: Download
  Download files from the remote store and keep them unencrypted on a location available in the local filesystem.

2: Index
  Builds an index file to figure out what data is contained inside the files downloaded

3: Restore
  Restores the files to a destination you choose


Optionally you can also run:
----------------------------

4: List
  Shows what files are available and tests filters

5: Recompress
  Ability to change compression type of files on remote backend e.g. from 7z to ZIP




Command descriptions:
=====================


Download
--------

Usage:
%RECOVERY_EXE% download <remoteurl> <localfolder> [options]

Downloads all files matching the Duplicati filenames from <remoteurl> to <localfolder>, and decrypts them in the process.
The remote url must be one supported by Duplicati.
Use `%CLI_EXE% help backends` to see backends and options.



Index
-----
%RECOVERY_EXE% index <localfolder> [options]

Examines all files found in localfolder and produces an index.txt file, which is a list of all block hashes found in the files.
The index file can be rather large. It defaults to being stored in <localfolder> but can be specified with --indexfile.
Some files are created in the system temporary folder, use --tempdir to set an alternative temporary folder location.



Restore
-------
%RECOVERY_EXE% restore <localfolder> [version] [options]

Restores all files to their respective destinations. Use --targetpath to choose another folder where the files are restored into.
Use the filters, --exclude, to perform a partial restore.
Version can be either a number, a filename or a date. If omitted the most recent backup is used.

The restore process requires a fast lookup, which is optimal if all the hashes can be kept in memory.
Use the option to --reduce-memory-use=true to toggle a slower low-memory restore.
If the process is interrupted for any reason, note the file counter and use --offset=1 to start the restore after the first file.

Advanced performance options are:
  --reduce-memory-use: Disables keeping all hashes in memory; use if memory is limited on the restoring machine
  --disable-file-verify: Disables the initial hashing of the restored file
  --disable-wrapped-zip: Disable using the faster .NET native ZIP archive in favor of the more resilient one in Duplicati
  --max-open-archives: Sets the number of archives to keep open for faster access (uses some memory pr. archive); default 200

List
----
%RECOVERY_EXE% list <localfolder> [version] [options]

Lists contents of <localfolder> backups.
Version can be either a number, a filename or a date. 
If [version] is omitted a list of backup versions are shown, if [version] is supplied, files from that version are listed.
Use the filters, --exclude, to show a subset of files.



Recompress
----
%RECOVERY_EXE% recompress <targetcompression> <remoteurl> <localfolder> --reupload --reencrypt [options]

1) Downloads whole remote storage to <localfolder>.
2) Recompress from existing compression type to <targetcompression>
3) If --reencrypt is supplied, again reencrypts using same passphrase (needs to be decrypted for compression type change)
4) If --reupload is supplied, files with old compression are deleted and recompressed files are uploaded back to remote storage (it is recommended to take at least temporary copy of remote storage before enabling this switch)

If --reupload is supplied it is advisable to specify --reencrypt for perfect security.

Warning: Before recompress delete local database and after recompress recreate local database before executing any operation on backup. This allows Duplicati to read new file names from remote storage.



Supported Options
-----------------
The backend modules support all their normal options.
To see what options a specific backend supports, type:
  %CLI_EXE% help <backend>

The environment variables AUTH_USERNAME and AUTH_PASSWORD are supported.
The options --parameters-file and --tempdir are supported.
