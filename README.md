- Flexible backup options: back up folders, specific file types (e.g., documents or images), or use custom filters.
- Available as a user-friendly application or a command-line tool.
- Supports backing up open or locked files using Volume Snapshot Service (VSS) on Windows or Logical Volume Manager (LVM) on Linux.
- Advanced options for filters, deletion rules, transfer settings, bandwidth limits, and more.

# Why Use Duplicati?

Keep your data safe, store it remotely, and back it up regularly! Many backup solutions fail to meet these essential requirements, but Duplicati excels at all three:

- **Keep your data safe:** Duplicati uses strong encryption to ensure your data remains private. With a secure password, your backup files are safer on a public web server than unencrypted files at home.
- **Store your backup remotely:** Protect your data from local disasters like fires by storing backups on remote servers. Duplicati supports incremental backups, making it efficient to use distant storage destinations.
- **Backup regularly:** Outdated backups are as good as no backups. Duplicati's built-in scheduler ensures your backups are always current. It also uses compression and incremental backups to save storage and bandwidth.
