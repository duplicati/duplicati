The SharpCompress.dll file in this folder is a build from:
https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress/commit/356c977cff161166f91f1db6bb96fe185e5d793a

This is required to include the zip64 fixes implemented here:
https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress/commit/f8538403e4697a7a0f582d4fafb58b79dce2750d

Once a SharpCompress version > 0.15.2 is released, that version should be used instead.
