## Backends that do not require Environment variables

* FTP _(TestContainers required)_
* SSH _(TestContainers required)_
* Webdav _(TestContainers required)_
* CIFS _(TestContainers required)_

Please note that TestContainers token has to be configured in secrets/Github actions yml.

## Backends that require Environment variables

## Google Drive:

Google Drive credentials are mapped to the following environment variables:

```
TESTCREDENTIAL_GOOGLEDRIVE_FOLDER
TESTCREDENTIAL_GOOGLEDRIVE_TOKEN
```
## S3

S3 credentials are mapped to the following environment variables:

TESTCREDENTIAL_AZURE_ACCESSKEY
TESTCREDENTIAL_AZURE_CONTAINERNAME
```

## pCloud Native API

```
TESTCREDENTIAL_PCLOUD_SERVER
TESTCREDENTIAL_PCLOUD_TOKEN
TESTCREDENTIAL_PCLOUD_FOLDER
```
For PCloud the server is the API server(eapi.pcloud.com for EU hosted account or api.pcloud.com for non EU). The token is the OAuth token.

## Running the tests

[TestContainers](https://testcontainers.org/) is a pre-requisite for SSH, FTP and Webdav tests. It is not required for the other tests.

Set the environment variables as described above, then run the tests using the following commands:

Minimal Verbosity:

`dotnet test Duplicati.Backend.Tests.sln --logger:"console;verbosity=normal"`

Running with full verbosity (useful if tests are failing):

`dotnet test Duplicati.Backend.Tests.sln --logger:"console;verbosity=detailed"`

Running specific tests:

`dotnet test Duplicati.Backend.Tests.sln --logger:"console;verbosity=detailed" --filter="Name=TestDropBox"`
