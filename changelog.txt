==========
- update Github tests versions, thanks @taz-il
- Add Catalyst Cloud as an OpenStack target, thanks @Andrew Ruthven

2023-05-25 - 2.0.7.1_beta_2023-05-25
==========
After almost 2 years, a new Beta has taken its time, but it’s finally 
there. It’s a roll-up of all the fixes since the last beta build and is 
expected to cause very few issues when upgrading. This release is almost 
identical to Canary 106.

It involves a better UI for dark mode, better support for Dropbox, 
Jottacloud, S3, Tencent backends, add IDrive backend, TLS modernization, 
bug fixes, upgrades to libraries.

Points of attention:

- database upgrade from 11 to 12: Downgrade from this version requires 
manually adjusting the version 
number in the database. The additions can be re-applied if the database is 
upgraded again later.

2021-05-03 - 2.0.6.1_beta_2021-05-03
==========
## First beta build in over a year!

We have been hard at work adding new features and fixing issues. This beta release is a roll-up of all the fixes since the last beta build and is expected to cause very few issues when upgrading. This release is based on 2.0.6.0_experimental.

A big thanks to all Duplicati contributors, supporters, fans and users for keeping the project evolving and improving.

### New in this version

- Added Tardigrade backend
- Added Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS)
- More Docker image versions
- Improved long-path support on Windows

We changed some larger things that you should be aware of when upgrading.

### The SSH backend has been updated
This update increases the security by prefering stronger encryption algorithms.
However, this _can_ cause failing backups as the host key is reported as "changed".
If this happens, edit the backup and update the host key.

### Database version update from v10 to v11!
Downgrade from this version requires manually adjusting the version number in the database. The additions can be re-applied if the database is upgraded again later.

### Other changes that needs attention

- Duplicati now requires Mono 5.10 or greater
- S3 and Sharepoint option names on commandline now uses `-` for consistency (previously used `_`)

2021-03-10 - 2.0.5.114_canary_2021-03-10
==========
## This build intends to remove some erronous warnings from the S3 backend introduced in the previous canary.

## Detailed changes

* Fixed the cURL error message url, thanks @warwickmm
* Fixed the S3 warning messages, thanks @warwickmm

2021-03-07 - 2.0.5.113_canary_2021-03-07
==========
## This build has two potentially breaking changes:

### The Telegram backend is no longer included
If you rely on this backend, do not upgrade.

### The SSH backend has been updated
This update increases the security by prefering stronger encryption algorithms.
However, this _can_ cause failing backups as the host key is reported as "changed".
If this happens, edit the backup and update the host key.

==========
This beta release is a collection of additions and improvements from many contributors.
Since it is released more than a year after the last beta, there is a large number of changes.

Important notes:
* On Linux, macOS, and other systems that require Mono, this version requires Mono v5 or later.

* On macOS please remove the current beta and install this version, instead of using the updater. Doing so, will make Duplicati compatible with Gatekeeper and allow you to grant permissions.

A big thanks to all Duplicati contributors, supporters, fans and users for keeping the project evolving and improving.

Note that the beta `v2.0.4.23` has database version `8` and this release has database version `10`. This means that your local database will be upgraded once you run this version, and you cannot roll back without some manual intervention.

Here is a short list of some of the more notable changes:

* Numerous bug fixes and performance enhancements.
* Updated translations, new languages added.
* Improved support for macOS Catalina
* Add support for minio backend.
* Improve tray icon to reflect warning state.
* Fix long path issue when path has 259 or 260 characters.
* Remove support for Amazon Cloud Drive.
* Fix input issues with dark theme.
* Fix bug in handling filter expressions.
* Fix purge operation with simple filters and case-sensitive filesystems.
* Fix ignoring of --tempdir option when using the command-line.
* Improved list of S3 compatible options and providers.
* Fix ability to stop backup after current file has finished processing.
* Updates to support libraries
* Improve logging during database recreation.
* Add option to skip vacuum operations within specified duration, `--auto-vacuum-interval`.
* Add option to skip compact operations within specified duration, `--auto-compact-interval`.
* Fix backup corruption from upload throttling. #3787
* Fix for “Unexpected difference in fileset”. #3800
* Fix for “CheckingErrorsForIssue1400” and “FoundIssue1400Error”. #3868
* Fix for “FTP (Alternative)” upload verification.
* Server database version is still 6. Backup database rose to 10. This may impede downgrades.

2020-01-03 - 2.0.5.0_experimental_2020-01-03
==========
This is once again a cumulative release for more than 6 months of hard work.
This release has a large number of stability improvements and speed optimizations.

If you are using macOS, please re-install from the .dmg or .pkg, as the launcher has been updated to work with GateKeeper.
Using the built-in update mechanism will not update the launcer and will not work well with GateKeeper on macOS Catalina.

A big thanks to the community members who work hard with fixing issues and responding on the forum:
