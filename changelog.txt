2026-01-08 - 2.2.0.103_canary_2026-01-08
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Changes in this versions
This version re-introduces the Synology native package, adds support for remote locking of files, and fixes a number of minor issues.

## Synology native package
The Synology native package has been re-developed to support the new Synology DSM 7.2 and above.
This package installs as any other Synology package and uses the integrated DSM authentication to guard access, so only system admins can use Duplicati.
To use the package, you need to grant access to the shared folders that you want to back up.

## Remote locking of files
This release adds support for remote locking of files, which is useful for example when using Duplicati with a remote storage provider that supports locking, such as S3 or Azure Blob Storage.
The feature works by completing the backup as usual, and then locking all files that are required to restore the backup.
The locking is done by asking the remote storage provider to lock the files, such that it is not possible to delete or overwrite the required files until the lock expires.
Duplicati then keeps track of the locks and avoids attempting to delete or overwrite the locked files.

To use the feature, set the advanced option `--remote-file-lock-duration` to the duration of the lock, for example `30D` for 30 days.

Since locking requires support from the remote storage provider, this feature is only available for certain backends. 
The locking is currently supported for S3, Azure Blob Storage, Backblaze B2, and iDrive e2.

Each of the backends that currently support locking also have a property to set the locking mode to either `governance` (default) or `compliance`.
The `governance` mode allows the lock to be removed in the admin console for the storage provider, while the `compliance` mode does not allow the lock to be removed.

If using this feature, note that each provider has different requirements for the bucket, usually requiring versioning to be enabled.
For S3 and B2, deleting the files after the lock expires will create a delete marker, which means that you will still be billed for the storage of the files, and need to set up lifecycle rules to actually delete the files after the lock expires.
For Azure Blob Storage, deleting the files after the lock expires will delete the files immediately.

## Change to default database encryption
Carried over from 2.2.0.102_canary_2025-12-12, this release has a "default secret provider" for the current OS.
The mapping is:
- Windows: Windows Credential Manager
- MacOS: Keychain
- Linux: libSecret (Gnome Keyring), or commandline `pass` if available

**Warning**: If there is no secret provider set, this change will cause the **database to be encrypted** with a random password, and the password will be stored in the default secret provider for the current OS.

## Detailed list of changes:
- Added Internxt S3 hostnames
- Added improved support for hosting ngclient behind a reverse proxy
- Added support for new API for remote management
- Added support for remote locking of files
- Re-introduced the Synology native package
- Removed AWS specific labels on S3 options
- Fixed a bug with testing on an empty destination
- Added support for authentication regions with S3, particularly for Minio

## ngclient changes:
- Added support for serving behind a reverse proxy
- Added support for hosting in an iframe, if configured
- Improved handling auth attempts so successful re-auth is not shown as messages
- Fixed proxied auth and websocket authentication
- Fixed advanced options for rclone not working
- Fixed hide connection status not showing when not connected

2025-12-12 - 2.2.0.102_canary_2025-12-12
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Changes in this versions
This release makes the S3 providers simpler to use by providing fewer options, and only showing relevant endpoints.

The release also adds support for excluding files based on extended attributes on Linux and MacOS, and adds support for supplementary access groups on Linux.

For Windows, the installer now supports `NOSCRIPT=true` which will prevent the installer from running scripts that start/stop the Windows service.

It is now also possible to change the encryption passphrase for a backup, using the RecoveryTool.

## Change to default database encryption
This release now has a "default secret provider" for the current OS.
The mapping is:
- Windows: Windows Credential Manager
- MacOS: Keychain
- Linux: libSecret (Gnome Keyring), or commandline `pass` if available

If no secret provider is given, the default secret provider for the current OS will be used.
The secret provider is then used to store secrets, inclduing the encryption password for the database and the password for the server, if using the TrayIcon to connect to the server.

**Warning**: This change will cause the **database to be encrypted** with a random password, and the password will be stored in the default secret provider for the current OS.

If you rely on getting the database contents for something, you need to ensure you also have a copy of the random password.

If you want to opt-out of this change, you can use the `--disable-db-encryption` option when starting the Server/TrayIcon.
If you already have an encryption password set, this change will not affect you.

If you are already using database encryption, and want to switch to the new managed way of storing the encryption password, you need to:
- Stop the server/TrayIcon
- Start the server/TrayIcon with the `--disable-db-encryption` option to remove the database encryption
- Remove the `--disable-db-encryption` option
- Remove the `--webservice-password` option or environment variable
- Start the server/TrayIcon again

## Detailed list of changes:
- Added Rabata.io to list of support S3 providers
- Added support for supplementary access groups on Linux
- Added support for excluding files based on extended attributes (MacOS / Linux)

2025-08-19 - 2.1.1.101_canary_2025-08-19
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Changes in this versions
This version has an update to the restore process that reduces the amount of temporary space used during restores. 
With the option `--restore-volume-cache-hint` it is now possible to choose how much size to use, and the dafult is 4GiB.

A problem with ngclient saving sizes with the default multiplier was fixed, and an improved list of destinations was added.

The breaking change in 2.1.1.100 with the `--allow-empty-source` was tested and found to have too many negative issues, so it was inverted to be `--prevent-empty-source` such that it is possible to turn it on, but it does not by default fail if the source folder is empty.

For Debian packages, the libICU package is now a recommended dependency and will not prevent installing the package.

- Streamlined suffixes for sizes to be the same
- Removed support for picking `bytes` as the multiplier
- Fixed issue with livelog page requesting invalid data when disabled

2025-08-08 - 2.1.1.100_canary_2025-08-08
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Changes in this versions

This build adresses an issue with timeouts on B2 uploads, along with a number of minor fixes.

There is a breaking change in that Duplicati will now consider an empty *source* folder as an error, unless you specify `--allow-empty-source`. This is done to avoid common mistakes where a folder was supposed to be mounted but was not.

The Docker images have been overhauled and now supports running with a custom UID/GID combination.

The login flow has been secured slightly and now features an extra nonce value that is required on requests. If you have custom code authenticating with Duplicati this is a breaking change.

Finally, there is now also an option to log internal HTTP requests to the log for tracing and debugging.

## Detailed list of changes:
- Fixed commandline test command issuing a warning
- Fixed erratic timeouts on B2
- Corrected reported timeouts in BackendTester
- Fixed some quoting of SQLite queries

2025-07-09 - 2.1.0.123_canary_2025-07-09
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
This version is nearly identical to 2.1.0.121 which has a startup crash.
This version is nearly identical to 2.1.0.122 which has an issue with detached TrayIcon.

# Major changes in this version

This version introduces a new SQLite library, a new VSS provider, and some minor bugfixes.

## SQLite update
This version has changed the SQLite library from the previous System.Data.SQLite library to using `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`.
This update was quite invasive, as the new SQLite library does not support positional arguments in SQL queries, which was used extensively in the Duplicati codebase.
With the update we see measurable speedups across all queries, and we are producing an article that describes our findings.
The update also bumps the SQLite library to use the latest available version and makes all SQLite queries async and cancelable, making the stop commands more responsive.

## New VSS provider supprt
The AlphaVSS library that is used for creating VSS snapshots is no longer being maintained.
This version now defaults to using the Vanara API layer to call the Windows VSS API and create snapshots.
Like before, this still requires the VC++ Redist to be installed.
For now, it is still possible to use AlphaVSS by setting `--snapshot-provider=AlphaVSS`.
Note that neither works on ARM64 as Windows is lacking libraries and tools for native ARM64 snapshots, only `--snapshot-provider=WMIC` works on ARM64.

## Bugfixing for ngclient
A number of reported compatibility issues with ngax has been fixed in this version.

## Detailed list of changes:
- Commandline UI expands environment variables

## SQLite update
This version has changed the SQLite library from the previous System.Data.SQLite library to using `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`.
This update was quite invasive, as the new SQLite library does not support positional arguments in SQL queries, which was used extensively in the Duplicati codebase.
With the update we see measurable speedups across all queries, and we are producing an article that describes our findings.
The update also bumps the SQLite library to use the latest available version and makes all SQLite queries async and cancelable, making the stop commands more responsive.

## New VSS provider supprt
The AlphaVSS library that is used for creating VSS snapshots is no longer being maintained.
This version now defaults to using the Vanara API layer to call the Windows VSS API and create snapshots.
Like before, this still requires the VC++ Redist to be installed.
For now, it is still possible to use AlphaVSS by setting `--snapshot-provider=AlphaVSS`.
Note that neither works on ARM64 as Windows is lacking libraries and tools for native ARM64 snapshots, only `--snapshot-provider=WMIC` works on ARM64.

## Bugfixing for ngclient
A number of reported compatibility issues with ngax has been fixed in this version.

## Detailed list of changes:
- Commandline UI expands environment variables
- The `file://` backend is no longer throttle exempt by default
- Fixed issue with TrayIcon not outputting help text in all cases
- No longer retains SeBackupPrivilege after testing for permissions
- Refresh token lifetime can now be configured
- Fixed multiple issues with kill signals not stopping the process
- Secret provider now correctly applied for all TrayIcon arguments
- Updated SQLite library to use `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` packages instead
- Default VSS provider is now Vanara
- Hide options that are not supported on the current OS
- Fixed backup schedule order after multiple missed backups
- Fixed an issue with Google Drive backend not creating folders
- Updated all localization, thanks to all translators

## Ngclient changes:
- Fixed issue with `--` option prefixes not being matched
- Updated all localization, thanks to all translators
- Fixed issue with en-GB not using 24h time format
- Fixed issue with editor for GCS not having a path field

2025-06-24 - 2.1.0.120_canary_2025-06-24
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

The intention is to tap this release as an experimental release if no significant issues are uncovered.

# Major changes in this version

This release is mostly fixing minor issues reported from 2.1.0.119, with only a few changes that could impact backups.
A significant amount of fixes has been completed for ngclient.

The repair flow can now detect and fix cases where a file or folder has been assigned no metadata.
Since the codebase does not support this, the current fix is to assign an empty metadata block if possible, and otherwise use the smallest metadata block.
The Test output no longer reports failures on index files that were fixed during the test process.

The destination picker UI in ngclient has been reworked in multiple ways, providing a more robust experience with the Test button and results being more prominent.

The restore flow and file picker has been updated to fix a number of issues with files and folders that have the same prefix.
Some issues with the picker not having the correct visual representation of the state.

==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

The intention is to tap this release as an experimental release if no significant issues are uncovered.

# Major changes in this version

## Index file corruption fixed
This update fixes a long-standing issue with index files being incomplete over time.
The effect of this is that the recreate database step takes much longer than expected.
With this update the index files no longer loose information during the compact step.

To remedy existing data, the test method can now be run and only check index files (`--full-remote-verification=indexesonly`).
By default, any defective index files that are found will be replaced with correct versions, so simply running the test command with a large sample size will fix the backup.

## Suppress warnings
A new option is added that can change warning messages to information messages, so the warnings no longer generate notifications.
The file access errors are now better grouped so it shows if the error is a permission error, a locked file error and others.
With the suppress feature it is possible to suppress one or more categories of these warnings.

## Better backend Test
The test feature has been updated to now check for write permissions, instead of just listing the remote folder.
For ngclient, the Test check now uses this extended check to inform the user if there are files in the destination folder.
This shows a warning if creating a new backup pointing to a folder with existing data, and a warning if attempting to restore from a folder with no files.
If the write part fails for a test during the restore flow, this is not treated as an error in ngclient. 

## Auto VSS on Windows
If the user has Administrator privileges (`SeBackupPrivilege`) VSS is now set to `Auto` by default.

## Updated backends
Updated the backends: Jottacloud, Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox, and OpenStack.
Removed the Sia backend as the current implementation is not compatible with the pending hard-fork.

## No throttle for the file backend
The file backend is now excempt (by default) from throttle settings via `--throttle-disabled-backends`.
Individual backups can set `--throttle-disable` to opt-out of throttling.

## Disabling reported options on Webserver
The ngclient is using the reported options to figure out what features can be enabled.
This can now be configured with `--webservice-disable-api-extensions` so websocket usage can be disabled, among others.

## ngclient updates
A number of fixes and additions are made to ngclient, including a new grid-view for users with many backups.

## Database version upgrade to v17
The local database is again upgraded with an index changes performance.
The bundled `Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe` / `duplicati-database-tool` can downgrade databases.
Since the change is only index addition, there is no data loss on downgrades.

==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Major changes in this version
This version has a number of minor fixes and a major rewrite of the the "repair" command.
The logic for the "repair" command is that it should be possible to recover loss of `.dblock` files, if the data is still present locally.
This logic has been fixed in multiple ways and now also supports recovering data, even if no individual `.dblock` volumes can be fully recovered.
In this case, the repair will recreate as much data as possible in new `.dblock` files, and configure it so as many files as possible are available.

The `purge-broken-files` can be used after repair has failed to recover eveything, and will only purge the files that were lost.
The `purge-broken-files` command has also been updated to support using incorrect metadata, such that files are not purged if they are only missing metadata.

There are again numerous fixes to ngclient, including some faster browsing of restore contents, and better remote validation of folder contents.
The UI now supports a number of different languages.

## Database version upgrade to v16
The local database is again upgraded with two index changes for correctness and performance.
The bundled `Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe` / `duplicati-database-tool` can downgrade databases.
Since the change is only index addition, there is no data loss on downgrades.

2025-04-25 - 2.1.0.117_canary_2025-04-25
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Major changes in this version
This update adresses a few edge cases where a crash or other problem could cause the database to become out-of-sync.

Support for "archived" files makes Duplicati more compatible with life-cycle rules, that moves files into longer-term storage.
The support is currently added for S3 and Azure Blob Storage, and works by not attempting to test files that are archived.
Compacting still needs to be turned off if using life-cycle rules where files are inacessible.

The version of the local database is updated to v15 to support the archive timestamp.

A new tool is added `Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe` / `duplicati-database-tool` which can downgrade databases.
The tool can be used prior to installing an older version, and will downgrade the database to the previous version (14 in this case).

The tool can target individual databases, but will default to take all databases in the storage folder.

Throttle options were broken with a recent update. The fixed version now shares the throttle between all transfers.
Previously, setting a 10kb/s limit would cause each individual stream to be capped to 10 kb/s, but now the setting will throttle the combined upload speed (each stream gets a fraction of the limit).

## Detailed list of changes:
- Added additional libICU compatibility versions
- Fixed an issue where dlist files would be uploaded ahead of time, causing failures on crashes
- Fixed an issue where compacting would sometimes kick off incorrectly
- File backend now throws the correct exceptions
- Ignore errors when closing and attempting pragma optimize
- Support reloading the page when restoring
- Added support for storage with archival options, like Glacier and Azure Cold storage
- Updated warning for cases where new files are found
- Added a database downgrade tool
- Added option to set SQLite cache size
- Fixed throttle not working, and made it a shared throttle
- Fixed an issue where the backup metadata could be cleared on save

## Ngclient changes:
- Continue button now works on editing backup
- Overlapping display on scrolling fixed
- Fixed Repeated background requests on some pages
- Database screen now shows the database state
- Improved support for resetting restore flow
- Settings page is more reactive to changes
- Server error messages are now shown

2025-03-15 - 2.1.0.111_canary_2025-03-15
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Major changes in this version

- Restore improvements
This version has a few tweaks to the new restore flow that makes it more robust.

- Improved validation
To safeguard against internal errors, there is now a more strict validation before performing cleanup.
The new logic checks if the previous operation failed and will only automatically repair the remote if this is the case.
The repair command bypasses this check and can repair the remote regardless.

If the previous run was fully completed, any leftover remote files are now treated as an error.
Additionally, operations that does not change remote state (list, test, restore, etc) will not repair the remote state, but just verify that it is working for the requested operation.

- Updates to ngclient
Multiple updates to ngclient: improved auth flow, searchable menus, Windows filesystem support, restore from configuration, and more.

# Potentially breaking changes (from 2.1.0.109)
  - Location of data folder has changed in some cases, refer to previous release for details
  - Permissions are now applied to the data folder, refer to previous release for details
  - New user interface, `ngclient` is the default; there is a button to switch between the two

## Detailed list of changes:
- Reduced number of samples taken for testing
- Improved restore flow
- Improved error handling for Azure Blob storage
- Improved help text for remote synchronization tool
- Implemented more rigorous validation and safeguards for failed backups
- Better support for IPv6 and unmapped localhost scenarios
- Added check to avoid block sizes that are the same or less than volume size
- Introduced more async calls for better thread usage in handlers
- Added forced culture for SQL strings and simpler transaction logic
- Added Arm v7 Agent builds
- Improved certificate validation to check expiration and support root or intermediate certificate hashes

2025-02-28 - 2.1.0.110_canary_2025-02-28
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Major changes in this version

- Restore improvements
Building further on the new restore engine, this version has significant performance speedups during restore.

- New signing keys
The builds are now signed by "Duplicati Inc" for MacOS and Windows.
The Windows signatures are now done with an extended validation (EV) certificate and should not trigger Windows Defender warnings.

- New enumeration logic
The enumeration of files and folders has been rewritten to better support some edge cases.

- Improved pagination support
All backends are updated to support the new list methods that supports pagination and cancellation. 
The test method will now only load a single page of results, instead of listing all items.

- Support for backend-as-source
This version has support for backups of both remote and local data.
In this version, S3, IDrive, SSH and CIFS sources are supported.
The UI does not yet support this, but it is possible to read data from a remote location by "mounting" it into the local filesystem.
For the commandline (and manual text entry in the UI) enter sources such as:
```
// Linux/MacOS
@/mnt/s3-data|s3://example?auth-username=...

// Windows
@X:\server1|cifs://server/share?auth-username=...
```

# Potentially breaking changes (from 2.1.0.109)
  - Location of data folder has changed in some cases, refer to previous release for details
  - Permissions are now applied to the data folder, refer to previous release for details

- Performance optimizations for restore process

2025-02-11 - 2.1.0.109_canary_2025-02-11
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.

# Important change for Windows Service
This build changes the folder locations for the `Duplicati-server.sqlite` file on Windows and Linux when running as a service.
There is support for backwards compatibility, so existing installations should not be affected.

The detailed changes are:
Windows: Avoid storing data in `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Duplicati` and prefer `{CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA}\Duplicati`
Linux: Avoid storing data in `/Duplicati` and prefer `/var/lib/Duplicati`.

If you are not running Duplicati as a service, this has no effect.
If you are using `--server-datafolder` or `DUPLICATI_HOME`, this has no effect on the database, but may cause your machineid and installid to change.

The `machineid.txt` and `installid.txt` would previously be stored in the local app data folder, even when using portable mode or choosing a specific data folder.
This has been fixed, so the files will now follow the database.
If you are using the Duplicati console or otherwise depend on these values, you need to move them into the folder where the database is stored.

## Important for users running 2.1.0.108
For **2.1.0.108 version only**, the service folder was `{SYSTEMDRIVE}\Users\LocalService\Duplicati` which was dropped.
If you have only installed 2.1.0.108 and ended up using the previous folder, you must manually move it to `{CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA}\Duplicati`.

# Permissions on database and data folder
This update sets permissions on the data folder and the databases to prevent unauthorized access from local accounts.
To opt out of setting permissions on each startup, place a file named `insecure-permissions.txt` inside the data folder.

# New user interface
This version uses the `ngclient` as the default interface. If some feature is not working as expected, it is possible to switch back to the `ngax` client.
To switch client, replace `ngclient` with `ngax` in the url, or use the `theme.html` page to choose the UI (example: `http://localhost:8200/theme.html`).
Please report any issues with the new UI.

# Removed timeout guard
Due to many reports of failures with the timeout mechanism this has been removed in the current version. It will be added back into each of the backends later.

# Added a new tool for offsite backup
This release features a new tool: `Duplicati.CommandLine.SyncTool.exe` / `duplicati-sync-tool` which can be used to create copies of backup files in multiple locations. The tool is currently documented with the built-in help, and more documentation is on the way. The tool is intended to be more integrated into Duplicati later and enables a straightforward way to achieve 3-2-1 backups, including copies in immutable storage.

## Detailed list of changes:
- Support topics on Telegram reports
- Added remote syncronization tool
- Removed high-level backend timeout
- Added guard to prevent dataloss on shared destinations
- Added option to disable automatic update checks
- Fixed a bug with the new restore that could cause incorrect files to be restored if files alredy exists
- Fixed a case where updated timestamps were discarded if no data was changed
- Added permission updates to data folder
- Fixed automatic fallback on unsupported Zip files
- Fixed multiple issues with TrayIcon state
- Mark Mega.nz backend as deprecated
- Switched to ngclient as the default UI
- Added support for 429 responses on B2

# New tool to manage a running server
Due to incompatibility with `duplicati_client` a new tool is included, named `Duplicati.CommandLine.ServerUtil.exe`/`duplicati-server-util`.

The new tool can pause/resume a backup, run a backup, change the password and more:
https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/pull/5483

# Encrypting database fields
To reduce the risk of leaking encryption passphrases and credentials, 
many fields in the `Duplicati-server.sqlite` file can now be encrypted with user supplied key.

The following environment variables control the encryption options:
- `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Provides the settings encryption key.
- `DUPLICATI__REQUIRE_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=true`: Prevents starting with a key (also supported via `--require-db-encryption-key-true`).
- `DUPLICATI__DISABLE_DB_ENCRYPTION=true`: Forces Duplicati to run without encryption (also supported via `--disable-db-encryption=true`).

If you need to change the key, you can temporarily decrypt the database by starting the server with `--disable-db-encryption`.
After starting, stop the instance again, change `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to the new key and start again without the argument, to have it re-encrypted.

To downgrade from this version, run once with `--disable-db-encryption`, and change the version number to 7, then install the previous version.

**Note for users of 2.0.9.105:** The method for extracting an encryption key from the machine seriail number did not produce secure results. 
This feature has now been removed, and will prevent you from upgrading. To upgrade from 2.0.9.105, start with `--disable-db-encryption`, then exit, then upgrade to 2.0.9.106+.
Users from other versions than 2.0.9.105 will not have difficulties, and Docker users should not see any issues either.

## Detailed list of changes:
- Fixed console duration output including days
- Added blacklisting of some settings encryption keys
- Refactored the way databases are located to use shared code
- Fixed translation consistency issues, thanks @luixxiul
- Fixed missing commandline help on Windows
- Added dift support for JWT expiration
- Removed DeviceId as the source for settings encryption keys
- Fixed an issue where an authentication issue was reported as a server error
- Fixed MSI packages failing to upgrade
- Re-added the `FORSERVICE=true` flag to MSI packages
- Improved diganostics output from server-util

2024-08-29 - 2.0.9.105_canary_2024-08-29
==========
This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing in preparation of a later stable release.

**Unlike regular canary builds, this one has a major change in the build system, so it now runs on .NET8.**

For that reason, the updater in previous canary builds does not detect this update yet, but this can be activated at a later time.

**Important changes from last Beta**
- Updated to .NET8 with OS specific builds
- Using Kestrel as the API/UI server
- Mandatory password and new authentication scheme
- Settings database version updated to v8
- Encrypting data in `Duplicati-server.sqlite` with machine serial number

Please see list of known issues related to .NET8/Kestrel upgrade:

# New tool to manage a running server
Due to incompatibility with `duplicati_client` a new tool is included, named `Duplicati.CommandLine.ServerUtil.exe`/`duplicati-server-util`.

The new tool can pause/resume a backup, run a backup, change the password and more:
https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/pull/5483

# Encrypting database fields
To reduce the risk of leaking encryption passphrases and credentials, 
many fields in the `Duplicati-server.sqlite` file will be encrypted after running this version.
The key used to encrypt is derived from the machine serial number, so **the database cannot be decrypted on another machine**.

If your strategy relies on being able to read this database, you must take action.
These two setups are vulnerable:
- If you do not store a copy of the passphrase elsewhere
- If you make a copy of the settings database

We strongly recommend that you store a copy of the passphrase(s) securely, regardless of your setup.

If you want to choose the settings encryption key, you can set the environment variable `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to a custom value.
If you want to never use the serial number as the passphrase, set the environment 
variable `DUPLICATI__REQUIRE_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=true`, which will prevent Duplicati from starting without a user provided key.

If you need to change the key, you can temporarily decrypt the database by starting the server with `--disable-db-encryption`.
After starting, stop the instance again, set `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and start again without the argument, to have it re-encrypted.

To downgrade from this version, run once with `--disable-db-encryption`, and change the version number to 7, then install the previous version.

As always, feedback is appreciated!

This build is changes the underlying webserver to Kestrel, which is common for .NET based projects.
A big thanks to @tsuckow and @npodbielski for their contributions towards this goal.

** This build changes authentication for the WebUI **
With this build it is no longer possible to use the web-UI without a password. 
If no password is set, a random password is generated.
For users activating the UI via the TrayIcon, this will automatically log in, as the TrayIcon hosts the server.
For users that rely on the WebUI without the TrayIcon, as special link is emitted during startup that allows login.
For both cases, the password can be (re-)set with `--webservice-password=...` as a startup commandline argument.

## Detailed lits of changes:
- Updated libraries: Mega, SharpAESCrypt, Storj, FluentFTP
- Updated Webserver to Kestrel, thanks @tsuckow and @npodbielski
- Implemented websocket based messages in WebUI, thanks @npodbielski

## These are some of the major changes that can cause surprises, so please review and see if any are relevant for your usage:

- Changed runtime to .NET8, shipping with dependencies, no more Mono or .NET install required
- Changed from portable executable to operating system and CPU architecture dependent packages
- Server database with SQLite is no longer "encrypted" with RC4, running a new canary or later will decrypt the database
- The executable `Duplicati.Library.AutoUpdater.exe` is renamed to `Duplicati.CommandLine.AutoUpdater.exe` and has limited functionality
- The Windows MSI installer has been reduced, it offers essentially no options for now and no UI
- The updater has been rewritten to rely on installing the packages, instead of having the "in-place" updates
  - There are now longer a spawned secondary process
  - The updates folder can be deleted
  - Installing an update now requires manually downloading and running the installer (you still get a notice)
 - To fit better with non-Windows systems the executables on non-Windows are all lower-case and prefixed with `duplicati`:
    - `Duplicati.GUI.TrayIcon.exe` -> `duplicati`
    - `Duplicati.CommandLine.exe` -> `duplicati-cli`
    - `Duplicati.RecoveryTool.exe` -> `duplicati-recovery-tool`
    - ... and similar for others

2024-04-19 - 2.0.7.103_canary_2024-04-19
==========
- Added microfix that adds a missing default value to the backup reports.

2024-04-03 - 2.0.7.102_canary_2024-04-03
==========
This build is intended to be the last build that uses .Net4 (aka .Net Desktop).
Future builds are expected to use .Net8 and will require a manual update,
because the .Net builds are no longer operating system independent.

The upside is that there are fewer dependencies (no more Mono),
and execution times are greatly improved.

2023-05-25 - 2.0.7.1_beta_2023-05-25
==========
After almost 2 years, a new Beta has taken its time, but it’s finally 
there. It’s a roll-up of all the fixes since the last beta build and is 
expected to cause very few issues when upgrading. This release is almost 
identical to Canary 106.

It involves a better UI for dark mode, better support for Dropbox, 
Jottacloud, S3, Tencent backends, add IDrive backend, TLS modernization, 
bug fixes, upgrades to libraries.

Points of attention:

- database upgrade from 11 to 12: Downgrade from this version requires 
manually adjusting the version 
number in the database. The additions can be re-applied if the database is 
upgraded again later.
